*Timestamped On-Chain Moments — Immortalize Your Life*

## **The Problem**

In a world where digital content can be easily altered, deleted, or forged, there’s no reliable way to **prove the authenticity and timestamp of a real-life event**. Social media posts can be edited or removed, cloud storage can be compromised, and centralized platforms control the narrative.
There’s a growing need for a **trustless, verifiable, and permanent record** of real-life moments — especially for legal evidence, historic documentation, or personal milestones.

## **The Solution**

**ProofCapsule** is a decentralized protocol that lets users capture a moment — a photo, video, or note — and **anchor it permanently to the blockchain** with a cryptographic proof and a tamper-proof timestamp.
Your memories, achievements, and evidence are **immutable, censorship-resistant, and verifiable by anyone** — forever.

## **Core Idea / Use Cases**

* **Personal Milestones** – Weddings, graduations, first steps — immortalized and verifiable.
* **Historical Documentation** – Capture events as they happen, creating a permanent archive.
* **Proof of Presence** – Verify attendance at protests, meetups, conferences.
* **Legal / Compliance Evidence** – Certify the existence of documents or media at a specific time.
* **Collectible Memories** – Mint moments as NFTs for personal archives or sharing.

---

## **How It Works**

1. **Capture the Moment** – User uploads an image/video or text snippet.
2. **Hash Generation** – The content is hashed locally to ensure privacy (no raw media stored on-chain).
3. **On-Chain Timestamp** – The hash and metadata (time, geotag, optional description) are stored in a smart contract.
4. **Proof Capsule** – The user receives a **Proof Capsule NFT** representing that unique moment.
5. **Verification** – Anyone can verify authenticity by re-hashing the original content and comparing it to the on-chain record.

## **Architecture**

* **Frontend (Next.js / React)** – User interface for capturing, uploading, and viewing moments.
* **Smart Contracts (Sonic)** – Store immutable hash, timestamp, and metadata.
* **Decentralized Storage (IPFS/Arweave)** – Optional raw content storage.
* **Oracles** – Provide trusted timestamps and optional geolocation data.
* **Verification API** – Open endpoint for checking authenticity of any Proof Capsule.

## **Features**

* **Immutable Proof** – Cryptographic guarantee of authenticity.
* **Privacy-Preserving** – Original media stays private unless user opts in.
* **NFT Representation** – Every Proof Capsule is an NFT you own.
* **Geotagging** – Optional proof of location for added context.
* **Social Sharing** – Share your Proof Capsule link for public verification.
* **Batch Capture** – Certify multiple files in one transaction.
